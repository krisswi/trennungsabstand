Lightning Protection Separation Distance Calculator

This web-based tool calculates the required separation distance s in lightning protection systems.

It supports both the European simplified method according to EN 62305 and the Swiss method according to SN 414022:2024.

The application is intended for professional use in Switzerland, particularly for inspection, planning and verification of lightning protection systems.

Supported Calculation Methods

1. EN 62305 – Simplified Approach

s = (k_i / k_m) \cdot k_c \cdot l

Where:
	•	kᵢ – factor depending on Lightning Protection Level (LPL I–III)
	•	kₘ – factor depending on insulation medium (e.g. air, masonry, concrete)
	•	k_c – current distribution factor (depending on number of down conductors and earthing type)
	•	l – length along the down conductor to the nearest equipotential bonding or earth termination point

This represents a practical engineering approximation for field use.

2. SN 414022:2024 – Swiss Method

s = k \cdot (n_0 / n) \cdot A

with

n_0 = U / x_n

Where:
	•	k – factor depending on LPL
	•	xₙ – spacing parameter according to the Swiss guideline
	•	U – building perimeter
	•	n – number of down conductors
	•	A – length along air termination or down conductor

This method reflects the Swiss national lightning protection guidelines.
